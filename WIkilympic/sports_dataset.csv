Archery;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Korea_Olympic_KiBobae_05_%287730586140%29.jpg;Archery is a precision sport that involves using a bow to propel arrows at a designated target. The fundamental objective is to shoot the arrows as close as possible to the center of the target face, which is typically marked with concentric scoring rings. In target archery, the most common competitive discipline, archers shoot a set number of arrows from a fixed distance at a stationary, circular target. Scoring is based on which ring the arrow penetrates, with the inner-most ring (the gold) yielding the highest point value, usually 10 points. If an arrow touches a line between two scoring zones, the higher score is awarded.;both;target_sport;United Kingdom;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom_%283-5%29.svg/1200px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom_%283-5%29.svg.png;20000;Archery has prehistoric roots, used globally for hunting and warfare.

It encompasses diverse disciplines, broadly categorized into rifle, pistol, and shotgun events, each with distinct rules and equipment. In rifle and pistol competitions, athletes fire at stationary bullseye targets from set distances, often requiring extreme stillness from the standing, kneeling, or prone positions. Conversely, shotgun events like Trap and Skeet involve shooting at moving clay targets launched into the air at high speeds. Success in this sport demands intense mental focus, breath control, and meticulous physical discipline to consistently hit the center mark.;individual;target_sport;Germany;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Flag_of_Germany.svg/1280px-Flag_of_Germany.svg.png;1477;Competitive shooting evolved from the military and hunting use of firearms.

Swimming;https://swimswam.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/adrian-ervin.jpg;Swimming is an individual or team racing sport that requires an athlete to propel their body through water using coordinated movements of all their limbs. Competitive events take place in pools (either $25\text{m}$ short course or $50\text{m}$ long course) or in open water. Races are categorized by four main strokes: freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly, as well as the individual medley which combines all four. Success relies on a combination of endurance, explosive power, and highly refined technique to minimize water resistance and maximize speed. It is one of the most popular sports at the Summer Olympic Games, drawing worldwide attention.

Trampoline Gymnastics;https://www.nbc.com/sites/nbcblog/files/2024/07/paris-2024-olympics-trampoline.jpg;Trampoline Gymnastics is a high-flying, Olympic-level sport where athletes perform complex acrobatic routines while continuously bouncing on a trampoline. These routines consist of a series of ten consecutive elements, which combine various somersaults and twists executed in precise body shapes like tuck, pike, or straight. Judges score the performance based on four main criteria: execution, difficulty of the skills, time of flight (time spent in the air), and horizontal displacement (staying near the center of the mat). The sport requires exceptional spatial awareness, control, and power, with gymnasts often soaring over 8 meters high to complete their breathtaking maneuvers.

Weightlifting;https://statik.tempo.co/data/2019/12/02/id_894064/894064_720.jpg;Weightlifting, or Olympic weightlifting, is a competitive strength sport where athletes attempt to lift the heaviest possible weight overhead using a barbell. The competition consists of two highly technical, explosive movements: the snatch and the clean and jerk. In the snatch, the barbell is lifted from the floor to an overhead position in one continuous motion. The clean and jerk is a two-part lift, first bringing the bar to the shoulders (the clean) and then driving it overhead (the jerk). The athlete's final score is the combined total of their highest successful lift in both events, and they compete across various bodyweight categories. It is a cornerstone of the Summer Olympic Games, testing power, speed, flexibility, and technique as much as pure strength.;individual;strength_sport;Greece;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Flag_of_Greece.svg/1200px-Flag_of_Greece.svg.png;1896;The act of lifting heavy objects as a test of strength dates back to ancient civilizations.
